Tomatoes Sorting System

I am developing an automated tomato sorting system based on weight and color. 
This system uses a load cell and the HX711 module to measure the weight of each tomato. 
Additionally, it employs the TCS34725 color sensor to determine the color of the tomatoes. 
The data from both sensors is processed and displayed on a 20x4 LCD screen, ensuring accurate sorting of the tomatoes based on predefined criteria. 
This setup aims to streamline the sorting process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in categorizing tomatoes by their weight and color.
